What did you like about this website?
    I like the color choices and the navbar is really nicely done.

Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.

Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    I think this person's codebase would be more maintainable since they have a more simple and consistent layout than mine does.

Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    Yes, the code is well structured within the files and they were all easy to find and indentify.

Did you have any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.

Were semantically appropriate elements selected?
    I think they were mostly correct other than the use of the span tag which I was a bit confused as to why it was necessary. I think span should be used more for styling in-line elements, and everything that was put into the span was also in the main tag, so it seemed a bit redundant. Also, I don't think it was necessary to give the main tag an ID since it's the only main on the page, the css identifier could have just been the main tag.

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    Other than small semantic things, the webiste is nicely made and very easy to use!
